# SRT Word Counter W/ Executable
## Based on [Github Gist by Zulln] (https://gist.github.com/zulln/4c46086a326928d01032)
- Took Github Gist and made it an executable that accepts any SRT file. :) Purely for Educational Purposes, anyone is welcome to use this, just check with the
original developer as I simply lifted the bulk of the code from their gist.
